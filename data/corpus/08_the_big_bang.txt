Around 13.7 billion years ago, everything in the entire universe was condensed in an infinitesimally small singularity, a point of infinite denseness and heat. Suddenly, an explosive expansion began, ballooning our universe outwards faster than the speed of light. This was a period of cosmic inflation that lasted mere fractions of a second. When cosmic inflation came to a sudden and still mysterious end, a flood of matter and radiation began populating our universe with the stuff we know today: particles, atoms, the stuff that would become stars and galaxies.

This all happened within just the first second after the universe began, when the temperature of everything was still insanely hot, at about 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 billion Celsius). The cosmos now contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as neutrons, electrons and protons â€” the raw materials that would become the building blocks for everything that exists today.

Over time, these free electrons met up with nuclei and created neutral atoms. This allowed light to finally shine through, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This light is known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
