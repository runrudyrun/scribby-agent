The story spans billions of years, tracking humanity's evolution alongside a series of god-like supercomputers. It begins in 2061 when two technicians ask the computer Multivac if the eventual heat death of the universe (entropy) can be reversed. Multivac's response is: "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER."

As humanity spreads across the stars, evolves beyond physical bodies, and merges into a single cosmic consciousness, the same question is posed to each of Multivac's increasingly powerful successors. Each time, through the eons, the answer remains the same.

Finally, as the universe fades into nothingness and the last stars die, humanity merges with the ultimate computer, the Cosmic AC, asking the question one final time before disappearing. The AC continues to ponder the question even after time and space have ceased to exist.

After a timeless interval, the AC finally discovers the answer. With no one left to give the answer to, it decides to demonstrate it. The story concludes with the AC's declaration: "LET THERE BE LIGHT!"
