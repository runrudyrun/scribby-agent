Prometheus, a Titan, is credited with creating the first humans from clay and being a friend to mankind. His name means 'forethought'.

The most famous story involves a trick he played on Zeus. Prometheus served an ox, giving the best meat to humans while disguising it, and offering bones disguised as a desirable portion to the gods. Angered by the trick, Zeus took fire away from humanity.

In defiance, Prometheus stole fire back from Mount Olympus, hiding it in the stalk of a giant fennel, and returned it to man. This act enabled humans to build civilizations.

For this transgression, Zeus punished Prometheus severely. He was chained to a rock where an eagle would eat his liver every day. Each night, his liver would regenerate, making the torture eternal. Eventually, he was freed by Heracles with Zeus's permission. The myth explores themes of knowledge, rebellion, and the consequences of defying the gods for the sake of humanity.
