Plato's Allegory of the Cave describes a group of people imprisoned in a cave since birth. They are chained, facing a blank wall, only able to see shadows projected onto it by objects passing in front of a fire behind them. For the prisoners, these shadows are their entire reality.

When one prisoner is freed, he is forced out of the cave and into the sunlight. The light is painful, and he is initially blinded. Slowly, his eyes adjust, and he begins to see the true forms of objects, reflections, the stars, and finally, the sun itself. He realizes that the shadows in the cave were mere imitations of the real world.

Filled with this new understanding, he returns to the cave to share his discovery. However, having been in the sunlight, he is now blind in the darkness of the cave. The other prisoners see his blindness as a result of leaving the cave and conclude the outside world is harmful. They refuse to leave and threaten to kill anyone who tries to free them. The allegory represents the journey of the soul toward enlightenment and the philosopher's struggle to lead others out of ignorance.
