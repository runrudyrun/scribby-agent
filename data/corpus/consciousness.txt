Consciousness is a multifaceted concept. Philosophers describe it as subjective awareness, the state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. Neuroscientists, on the other hand, seek to understand the neural correlates of consciousnessâ€”the specific brain activity that corresponds to conscious experience. The 'hard problem' of consciousness is explaining why we have these subjective experiences at all.
