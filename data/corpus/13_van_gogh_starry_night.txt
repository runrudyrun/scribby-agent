The Starry Night was painted by Vincent van Gogh in June 1889. It depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence just before sunrise. The painting is an oil-on-canvas and is one of the most recognized works in Western art.

The dramatic sky, filled with swirling clouds, a bright crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiant orbs, captures the viewer's attention. The brightest 'star' is actually Venus, which was visible at dawn in Provence during the spring of 1889. The sky's expressive and emotional quality is a hallmark of the piece.

Below the turbulent sky rests a quiet village, which was not actually visible from his window but was added from imagination and memory, possibly reminiscent of his Dutch homeland. On the left, a massive, dark cypress tree, painted like a flame, rises to connect the earth and sky. The tree is often interpreted as a symbol of death and a connection to the cosmos.

Van Gogh himself had mixed feelings about the painting, at one point referring to it as a 'failure' because he felt he had been led astray into 'abstraction' rather than painting directly from nature. Despite his own critique, the work has become an icon of artistic expression, symbolizing the inner turmoil and profound emotional depth of the artist.
