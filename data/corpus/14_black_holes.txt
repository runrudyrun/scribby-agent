Black holes are huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. They are not actual holes. A black hole is so dense that its gravitational pull just beneath its surface, the event horizon, is strong enough that nothing—not even light—can escape.

Since they don't emit or reflect light, black holes are invisible. Scientists detect them by observing their effects on their surroundings. This includes watching stars orbit a central point, observing light from rings of gas and dust (accretion disks) that form around them, or detecting gravitational waves—ripples in spacetime created when massive objects like black holes collide.

Contrary to some popular beliefs, black holes are not cosmic vacuum cleaners that suck in everything around them. From a safe distance, their gravity is the same as any other object of the same mass. They are also not wormholes or portals to other dimensions. One type of black hole forms when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses in a supernova explosion. Most large galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have a supermassive black hole at their center.
